but more lightweight, replacement of the before mentioned tools.

new session named 'demo':

 $ abduco -c demo

An arbitrary application can be started as follows:

 $ abduco -c demo your-application

CTRL+\ detaches from the active session. All available sessions can be
displayed by running:

 $ abduco
