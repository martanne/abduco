abduco
======

abduco provides the session management and attach/detach functionality
of screen(1) and tmux(1) together with dvtm(1) it is a nearly complete,
but more lightweight, replacement of the before mentioned tools.

Quickstart
----------

Assuming dvtm is located somewhere in `$PATH`, the following creates a
new session named 'demo':

	$ abduco -c demo

An arbitrary application can be started as follows:

	$ abduco -c demo your-application

`CTRL+\` detaches from the active session. All available sessions can be
displayed by running:

	$ abduco
	Active sessions (on host hostname)
	  Fri    2014-11-14 18:52:36    demo

The session can be restored with

	$ abduco -a demo

Read the manual page for further information.
